#H2 _VideoAmp Code Test_

#h3 1.Write javascript that would be injected on a page and run within the context of an iFrame


#h3 2.This script should send a native XHR POST request with JSON detailing the number of display ads and their sizes (say 300x250, 160x200, video ads)

#h3 3.Describe (in either inline comments or in summary) about your methodology for determining whether something is an ad -X

#h3 4.Describe other possible metadata about these ads and what else you could record about a webpage or about a users

#h3 5.Build a simple node.js API (using Connect/Express, Hapi) with inline documentation to receive this data

#h3 6.Save that JSON response into a database of your choice (Mongo, SQL, etc.). What are the tradeoffs of DBMSs (scale? development?)

#h3 7.Describe how you would document this process if other developers were collaborating on the project

#h3 8.Provide at least (hopefully more) one example of a test (with the suite of your choice)

#h3 9.Describe what shortcuts you made and tradeoffs to real-world development

#h3 10.Write a Readme in Markdown to describe all of the above
